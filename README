BUG REPORTS:
------------
If you run this code and encounter problems, you must report
the bug by EMAIL to ircd-ratbox@lists.ratbox.org

Please include a gdb backtrace and keep the core file, binaries and 
modules in case the developers need them.

MODULE RESTARTS:
----------------
Note a running module should never be modified directly whilst it is loaded
into ircd as the behaviour of the OS can result in a core when this is done.

When upgrading modules, you should never simply cp over a module that is
loaded into ircd.  You may delete it then cp, mv it, unload the module from
ircd first, move the directory out of the way and start again or numerous
other things.

Just *dont* do something like: cp m_foo.so ~/ircd/modules/
