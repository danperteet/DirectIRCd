The files in adns/ were borrowed from the ADNS library and modified quite
heavily.  The original code's copyright notices are in adns/README.  

The modified portions are Copyright 2000 Aaron Sethman <androsyn@ratbox.org>

Basically what has changed is getting adns to work with our event loop and
IPv6 support.  Note that the IPv6 support isn't real great right now and may
not even work.  The IPv4 support seems okay though.
