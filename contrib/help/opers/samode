SAMODE <nick> <[+/-]usermodes> [[+/-]operflags]
or
SAMODE <channel> <+/-channelmodes> [other params required by channel modes]

The SAMODE command has two versions:
1. First version allows irc operator to change any user mode of any 
client and if +o usermode is used then also allows changing of 
all oper flags. That includes opering user up or deopering 
client if usermode -o was used. Works on remote users too.
Usable OperFlags:
O - oper can global kill        
R - oper can do squits/connects 
U - oper can use unkline        
G - oper can use gline          
N - oper can umode n            
K - oper can kill/kline         
X - oper can xline              
D - oper can die                
H - oper can rehash             
A - oper can set umode +a       
a - admin is hidden             
L - oper can operwall 
S - oper spy, not used, cannot be set in server config file
B - oper can remote ban
Z - oper is hidden from /stats p
For list of usable user modes check umode help topic.

Examples:
SAMODE jon +N    - Will give jon a network admin user mode.
SAMODE jon +o +S - Will give jon oper flag operspy and if jon is not an oper he will be opered up.
SAMODE jon -o    - Will deoper jon.
SAMODE jon +S    - Will give jon SSL umode.
SAMODE jon +x    - Will enable default hostmasking for jon, works even on spoofed hosts.
SAMODE jon +o -A - Will remove oper flag admin from oper jon.

2. Second version allows irc operator to change any channel mode on any channel
even if oper is not on that channel. Works also on local channels, but in this 
case will change modes only on channels that are on the same server as oper
using samode command. 
For list of usable channel modes check cmode help topic.

Examples:
SAMODE #secretchan +b - Will list current ban list of channel #secretchan.
SAMODE &secretchan +e - Will list current ban exempt list of local channel #secretchan.
SAMODE #secretchan +b jon!*@* - Will ban user with nick jon from channel #secretchan.
SAMODE #secretchan -k * - Will remove key from channel #secretchan.
SAMODE #secretchan +q jon - Will give jon channel owner status.
SAMODE #secretchan +O - Will set channel #secretchan as oper only.
