SAJOIN <nick> [flag]<channel>,[flag]<channel2>,...

The SAJOIN command requires only two arguments with optional status flag.
Valid mode flags are ~ ! @ % and +. This allows operators to join any user 
from any server into any channel with the given status. Command supports join 0.
If channel does not exist it will be join-created. If user is already in
channel and mode flag is set then given status will be set for that user.

Examples:
SAJOIN jon ~#secretchan - Will join user with nick jon to #secretchan with chan owner.
SAJOIN jon @#secretchan - Will join user with nick jon to #secretchan with chan ops.
SAJOIN jon +#secretchan - Will join user with nick jon to #secretchan with voice.
SAJOIN jon !&secretchan - Will join user with nick jon to local channel #secretchan with chan admin. 
SAJOIN jon &secretchan  - Will join user with nick jon to local channel #secretchan. 
SAJOIN jon 0            - Will part user with nick jon from all channels.

This also works on local channels as well. If used on remote client then user will be joined to local
channel on their server.
