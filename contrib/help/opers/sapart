SAPART <nick> <channel>,<channel2>,...

The SAPART command requires only two arguments.
This allows operators to part any user from any server out of
any channel.

Examples:
SAPART jon #secretchan - Will part user with nick jon from #secretchan.
SAPART jon &secretchan - Will part user with nick jon from local channel #secretchan. 

This also works on local channels as well. If used on remote client then user will be 
forced to part local channel on their server.
