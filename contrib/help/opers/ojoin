OJOIN [flag]<channel>,[flag]<channel2>,...

The OJOIN command requires only one argument with optional status flag.
Valid mode flags are ~ ! @ % and +. This allows operators to join any channel
with the given status.

Examples:
OJOIN @#secretchan - Will join you to #secretchan with chan ops.
OJOIN +#secretchan - Will join you to #secretchan with voice.

This also works on local channels as well.
