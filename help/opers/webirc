WEBIRC <cgi password> <username> <client real hostname> <client real IP address>

This command must be send before NICK and USER commands.
First parameter is used to validate CGI proxy and must
match password from corresponding auth block. Username
parameter is not used but its format is validated. 
Hostname and IP must be user real ones, their format 
is also validated.

If successful CGI proxy hostname and ip are changed to 
ones provided in WEBIRC command and user then connects
to IRC Server as normal. Additionally +W usermode is
set to such user.
