ircd-ratbox installation guide

------------------------------

1. If you are upgrading from an older release, read the whats-new files in
   doc/.  These contain the important notes for changes between major
   versions.

   The RELNOTES file contains the list of features and fixes since the
   previous releases.

   The README file contains important notes you should read.

2. Run the configure script.  By default it will attempt to install into
   /usr/local/ircd.  If you want it to install into this directory, then as
   root you must first:
     mkdir /usr/local/ircd
     chown youruser: /usr/local/ircd

   Then run everything as normal from your username.  ircd-ratbox will not
   run as root, *nor should any part of the build be run as your root user*.

   If you wish to install ircd-ratbox into a different directory, include
   the --prefix option:
     ./configure --prefix=/home/leeh/ircd

   ircd-ratbox will automatically pick the best IO subsystem for use.

   If you are on a "small" network, namely less than 5000 users, pass:
     --enable-small-net

   If you want ipv6 support:
     --enable-ipv6

   You should also configure how many clients your server will support:
     --with-maxclients=NUMBER

   If you wish support for ratbox-services read doc/services.txt and pass:
     --enable-services

   If your nick length or topic lengths are not 9 and 160 respectively:
     --with-nicklen=LENGTH
     --with-topiclen=LENGTH

   See ./configure --help for more options.  Naturally options should be
   combined so configure is only run once.

3. Run make

4. Run make install

5. Change to the directory it installed to

6. Edit etc/example.conf and save it as etc/ircd.conf

7. Run bin/ircd
