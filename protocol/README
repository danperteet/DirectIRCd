Contained in this folder are protocol modules for various services packages. 
All you must do to use these, is drop them into your services protocol 
modules folder, and add them to the makefile before compiling services. 
You can then load them like any other protocol module in your services 
config file. Thanks for using 
DirectIRCd, Your IRCd!
